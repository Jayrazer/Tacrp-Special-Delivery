##None of these ideas are final!

Honey Badger - Excels in close range because of light weight, good handling and up close damage but falls off quickly at range with low muzzle velocity.

Auto 5 - Think like a semi-auto Bekas.  Better range and spread than most shotguns but lower damage and poor handling.  Limited by low capacity.

Bizon - Amazing control and handling.  Low damage to balance the high capacity.

Contender - Literal pocket sniper.  Deadly power and accuracy and great handling, naturally limited by single-shot capacity and lack of iron sights.  Maybe only allow medium and sniper optics?

Double Defense - Good handling and evicerates up close, performs like your average video game shotgun beyond like, 10 feet (horrible spread).

DeLisle - Deadly quiet, functions better at range than most suppressed weapons, slow rate of fire.

FAMAS - Fast ROF and good accuracy but hard to control, locked to burst.

Groza - Gimmicky.  Uses subsonic ammo but isn't suppressed by default, naturally more quiet than other weapons and becomes moreso when suppressed.  Dont rly know what to do for it lmao.

MP40 - Great control, can't hit anything beyond maybe 50 yards because WW2 SMG, poor suppression because of low fire rate.

PKM - Area denial device.  Shreds armor and has decent range, offset by its lower ROF compared to MG4 and significantly heavier weight.

Type 54 - Same class as large, non-magnum pistols like USP and 1911 but performs better at range.  Like a bridge between 9mm and .45 ACP.

WA2000 - Semi-auto in the sniper category, .300 Win Mag variant.  Very powerful but heavy and slow and can waste ammo fast due to semi-auto with low mag capacity.
