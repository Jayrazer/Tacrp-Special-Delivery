# Tactical RP - Special Delivery

-------------------------------------------------

# Heads up, operators!  We just got a shipment of weird and exotic weaponry to HQ and command is passing them out to anyone who wants 'em.  These guns may require some unorthodox techniques to handle, so if you don't know what you're doing, uh...  I dunno!  Google the owner's manual or something!

-------------------------------------------------

Special Delivery is a small expansion pack for TacRP that includes weapons that required additional work in order to bring to life within Tactical Interventions flashy style.  Most of these required substantial animation edits or entirely custom animations in order to implement them.
