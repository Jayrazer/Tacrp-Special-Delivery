# Tactical RP - Special Delivery

-------------------------------------------------

## Heads up, operators!  We just got a shipment of weird and exotic weaponry to HQ and command is passing them out to anyone who wants 'em.  These guns may require some unorthodox techniques to handle, so if you don't know what you're doing, uh...  I dunno!  Google the owner's manual or something!

-------------------------------------------------

A small pack of 14 new weapons for TacRP, featuring more delightfully crusty Gamebanana models that some of you might recognize from classic GMod weapon addons.  Built around TacRP's mechanics and using modified TacInt animations, Special Delivery is the perfect addition to any tactical GMod player's arsenal.

[h1]But what's so special about this new pack?[/h1]

TacRP InterOps was an expansion featuring a multitude of new weapons, all created by taking models from third-party sources and rigging them onto TI's animations.  This posed a unique challenge, as certain weapon types like bullpups and break-action weapons couldn't be implemented owing to TI having no weapon with a suitable set of animations for them.  While some minor animation edits were made, we strayed away from more ambitious modifications, owing to the large amount of (mostly unused) animations that would need to be edited for every minor change we made (nearly 70-per weapon!).

That was until shortly after InterOps' completion when I felt the motivation to start seriously editing TacInt's animations in order to implement weapons we were previously unable to.  The weapon pack started with a loose theming of obscure and exotic weapons, but ultimately became somewhat of an InterOps addendum, touching on weapon types that weren't covered by that pack.

This weapon pack aims to pick up the pieces of what was ultimately left out of InterOps, and serve as a fun, natural addition to the expanding TacRP arsenal.
